### Breast Cancer Prediction

The purpose of this project was to diagnose tumors as beningn and malignant, incorporating both classification and regression methods. As part of this process, I trained and tested various models in order to gain the most accurate results from the algorithms. When plotting, I picked the best set of cancer features - determined by which ones had the highest correlation.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AnjaliPrabhu848/My-Portfolio.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
