### Breast Cancer Prediction

The purpose of this project was to diagnose tumors as beningn and malignant, incorporating both classification and regression methods. As part of this process, I trained and tested various models in order to gain the most accurate results from the algorithms. When plotting, I picked the best set of cancer features - determined by which ones had the highest correlation.
